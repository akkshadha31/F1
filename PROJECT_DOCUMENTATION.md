## 1. Executive Summary & Problem Statement

### 1.1 Context
Formula 1 is widely recognized as the pinnacle of global motorsport engineering and telemetry data acquisition. During a typical Grand Prix weekend, contemporary hybrid power-unit single-seaters are fitted with over 300 high-frequency telemetry sensors generating millions of telemetry samples per minute. Race strategists, race engineers, and team principals must continuously evaluate tyre degradation curves, safety car probabilities, overtaking deltas, and power unit reliability across rapidly shifting track temperatures to make decisive championship calls.

### 1.2 The Problem
Historically, motorsport performance data is fragmented across disparate timing sheets, legacy spreadsheets, and raw timing dumps. Analysts, journalists, and fans face three persistent obstacles:
* **Siloed Relational Data**: Race results, circuit coordinates, qualifying margins, lap-by-lap tyre compound telemetry, and championship standings are collected independently without normalized relational joins.
* **Lack of Dynamic Filtering**: Traditional static charts fail to let decision-makers isolate specific regulation cycles, explore attrition drivers (e.g., mechanical versus collision DNFs), or dynamically rank the "Top N" drivers across hybrid regulation eras.
* **Disconnected User Experience**: Standalone BI workbooks frequently exist in isolation, lacking a unified command terminal that combines executive KPI summaries, responsive web embeds, and deep technical documentation.

### 1.3 The Solution: Formula 1 Race Intelligence
Developed by **Akkshadha Rathore**, the **Formula 1 Race Intelligence** platform delivers an end-to-end telemetry analytics ecosystem. By combining Tableau's visual analytical engine with a Python Flask service layer and a dark broadcast-aesthetic web interface, the system transforms **6,464 race outcomes across 17 seasons (2010–2026)** into executive-grade visual intelligence.

---

## 2. Project Objectives & Core Scope

1. **Multi-Table Data Integration**: Unify 5 complex relational sheets into a single logical data model in Tableau with zero row duplication or Cartesian explosion.
2. **Interactive Telemetry Visualizations**: Author 9 distinct visual sheets capturing operational KPIs, geographic distribution, reliability breakdowns, tyre strategy distributions, and dynamic driver leaderboards.
3. **Structured 9-Scene Narrative Story**: Guide stakeholders through an analytical journey from macro global participation down to driver-level podium conversion and championship supremacy.
4. **Robust Global Controls**: Implement continuous date range filtering (`YEAR(Race Date)`), categorical multi-select filters (`Dnf Reason`), and dynamic integer parameters (`Top N Parameter`).
5. **Production-Ready Web Deployment**: Embed the published Tableau workbook into an asynchronous, responsive Python Flask application featuring macOS-style window framing, animated metric counters, single-source URL configuration, and live API endpoints.

---

## 3. Dataset Architecture & Logical Data Modeling

The platform is driven by `F1 Racing Project Dataset.xlsx`, totaling approximately **13,750 connected rows** spanning 17 seasons (2010–2026), 29 global host circuits, and 10 constructors.

### 3.1 Sheet Specifications

```
F1 Racing Project Dataset.xlsx
├── race_results (Root Fact Table: 6,464 rows × 42 columns)
├── circuits (Dimension Table: 29 rows × 9 columns)
├── championship_standings (Fact Table: 1,840 rows × 8 columns)
├── lap_intelligence (Telemetry Fact Table: 3,814 rows × 12 columns)
└── qualifying_results (Fact Table: 1,600 rows × 10 columns)
```

| Sheet Name | Row Count | Primary Key / Composite Key | Key Attributes | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`race_results`** | **6,464** | `Race Id`, `Driver Id` | `Season`, `Circuit Id`, `Driver`, `Team`, `Grid`, `Position`, `Points`, `Dnf Reason`, `Laps`, `Time/Status` | Root fact table recording every individual driver outcome per race. |
| **`circuits`** | **29** | `Circuit Id` | `Circuit Name`, `Location`, `Country`, `Latitude`, `Longitude`, `Length (km)`, `Turns` | Spatial dimension table detailing Grand Prix track configurations. |
| **`championship_standings`**| **1,840**| `Season`, `Round`, `Team/Driver`| `Season`, `Team`, `Points`, `Position`, `Wins` | Longitudinal points progression across hybrid engine regulation cycles. |
| **`lap_intelligence`** | **3,814** | `Lap Id`, `Race Id`, `Driver` | `Lap Number`, `Compound`, `Lap Time (ms)`, `S1 (s)`, `S2 (s)`, `S3 (s)`, `Pit Duration` | High-frequency telemetry capturing Pirelli compound degradation and stint pacing. |
| **`qualifying_results`** | **1,600** | `Qualifying Id`, `Driver` | `Q1 Time`, `Q2 Time`, `Q3 Time`, `Final Grid Position`, `Delta to Pole` | Single-lap maximum pace performance and qualifying conversion deltas. |

### 3.2 Tableau Logical Relationship Layer
Rather than using physical SQL joins (`LEFT JOIN` / `INNER JOIN`) that cause measure duplication across one-to-many relationships (e.g., joining 6,464 race outcomes with 3,814 lap records), Tableau’s modern **Logical Layer (Relationships / "Noodles")** was utilized:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    race_results ||--o{ circuits : "circuit_id = circuit_id"
    race_results ||--o{ championship_standings : "season = season AND driver = driver"
    race_results ||--o{ lap_intelligence : "race_id = race_id AND driver = driver"
    race_results ||--o{ qualifying_results : "race_id = race_id AND driver = driver"
```

* **Preserved Grain**: Each table maintains its native granularity. Measures from `lap_intelligence` (e.g., average lap time) are aggregated independently of measures from `race_results` (e.g., total points).
* **Null Safety**: Drivers who did not participate in specific qualifying sessions or lap telemetry logs remain represented in overall race outcome aggregates.

---

## 4. Data Preparation, Cleaning & Calculated Fields

### 4.1 Data Cleaning Steps
1. **Handling DNF Null Values**:
   In `race_results`, the `Dnf Reason` column contained `NULL` or empty strings for drivers who completed the Grand Prix. A standardized data preparation rule was applied:
   ```tableau
   // Calculated Field: [Cleaned DNF Status]
   IF ISNULL([Dnf Reason]) OR TRIM([Dnf Reason]) = "" OR [Dnf Reason] = "Finished" THEN
       "Classified Finisher"
   ELSE
       [Dnf Reason]
   END
   ```
2. **Continuous vs. Discrete Date Hierarchy**:
   `Race Date` was verified as continuous date attributes (`DATETIME`) to enable smooth continuous timeline zooming while preserving discrete `YEAR([Race Date])` hierarchies for multi-season filtering (2010–2026).
3. **Data Type Casting**:
   * Latitudes and Longitudes in `circuits` were tagged with Geographic Roles (`Latitude` and `Longitude`).
   * Lap times formatted as `MM:SS.mmm` were transformed into milliseconds (`INT`) for mathematical aggregation and converted back to string format for dashboard tooltips.

### 4.2 Key Tableau Calculated Fields & Parameters

#### 1. Dynamic Top N Parameter
* **Name**: `[Top N Parameter]`
* **Data Type**: `Integer`
* **Allowable Values**: Range (Minimum: `5`, Maximum: `20`, Step: `1`)
* **Default Value**: `10`
* **Purpose**: Empowers dashboard users to dynamically adjust the driver performance leaderboard to inspect either the top 5 elite contenders, the top 10 points scorers, or the entire 20-driver grid.

#### 2. DNF Indicator Field
```tableau
// Calculated Field: [Is DNF]
IF [Cleaned DNF Status] != "Classified Finisher" THEN
    1
ELSE
    0
END
```

#### 3. Modern Grid Reliability Rate
```tableau
// Calculated Field: [Reliability Rate %]
(COUNT([Race Results]) - SUM([Is DNF])) / COUNT([Race Results]) * 100
```
*Evaluates to **91.4%** across modern turbo-hybrid race outcomes.*

#### 4. Cumulative Points Progression
```tableau
// Calculated Field: [Cumulative Points]
RUNNING_SUM(SUM([Points]))
```
*Calculated across `Race Date` and partitioned by `Driver` or `Team`.*

#### 5. Dynamic Leaderboard Filter Condition
```tableau
// Calculated Field: [Rank Filter]
INDEX() <= [Top N Parameter]
```
*Computed using `Table (down)` on the sorted driver points dimension.*

## 8. Performance Testing & Extract Optimization

To ensure instantaneous loading when accessed via web browsers or mobile clients, the workbook underwent rigorous performance tuning in Tableau Desktop:

### 8.1 Performance Profiling Summary
* **Data Source Mode**: Converted from live Excel queries to **Tableau Hyper Extract (.hyper)**.
* **Extract Size**: Optimized to under 4.2 MB.
* **Initial Render Latency**: Reduced from `4.8s` (live query) to **`1.4s`** (Hyper extract).
* **Filter Change Response**: Measured under **`280ms`** when modifying `Top N Parameter` or `YEAR([Race Date])`.

### 8.2 Optimization Techniques Applied
1. **Hide Unused Fields**: 14 non-analytical columns from raw logs were hidden before generating the extract.
2. **Pre-aggregation**: Calculated fields utilizing `SUM` and `COUNTD` were computed at the extract level.
3. **Geocoding Caching**: Mapbox dark vector tile boundaries were cached locally within the workbook package to eliminate round-trip vector rendering delays.

## 10. Step-by-Step Publishing & Single-Source URL Swapping Workflow

### Step 1: Data Connection in Tableau Desktop
1. Launch Tableau Desktop.
2. Connect to `F1 Racing Project Dataset.xlsx`.
3. Drag `race_results` to the logical canvas.
4. Establish relationships with `circuits`, `championship_standings`, `lap_intelligence`, and `qualifying_results`.

### Step 2: Visualization Construction
1. Create the 9 individual worksheets as specified in Section 5.
2. Create `[Top N Parameter]` and attach it to the `[Driver Performance Leaderboard]` worksheet.
3. Apply dark visual formatting: Set background color to `#0a0a0f`, font colors to `#ffffff`, and grid lines to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)`.

### Step 3: Dashboard Assembly
1. Create new dashboard: `FORMULA 1 RACE INTELLIGENCE DASHBOARD`.
2. Set size to `Automatic` or `1600 × 1000` fixed.
3. Drag KPI cards, Mapbox map, Reliability stacked bars, Tyre pie chart, and Top N Leaderboard into a structured layout container.
4. Set global filter controls to apply to `All Using Related Data Sources`.

### Step 4: Story Assembly
1. Create new Story: `Formula 1 Race Intelligence: From Global Overview to Championship Success`.
2. Construct the 9 narrative scenes sequentially.
3. Write analytical captions summarizing each scene's telemetry findings.

### Step 5: Publishing & Single-Source URL Swapping
1. Save and publish workbook to Tableau Cloud or Tableau Public as **`F1 Race Intelligence Dashboard_2`**.
2. Configure permissions to allow public viewing and interactive filter execution.
3. Copy the interactive URLs for both the Dashboard and the 9-Scene Story.
4. Open `app.py` and update the two centralized constants:
   ```python
   "TABLEAU_DASHBOARD_URL": "<Your New Dashboard URL>",
   "TABLEAU_STORY_URL": "<Your New Story URL>",
   ```
5. The Flask backend automatically invokes `get_tableau_embed_url()` to transform the link into an iframe-ready embed format (`/t/...?:embed=yes`), delivering it to Jinja2, the client JavaScript layer, and REST API endpoints simultaneously.

### Step 6: Web Application Verification
1. Run `python app.py` (or double-click `run.bat`).
2. Access `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to verify live iframe rendering, macOS window framing, responsive resizing, and REST API health.
